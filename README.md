## lesson: adding onClick handlers to components

important takeaways from this lesson:
- all javascript inside jsx needs to be wrapped within expressions
- bind functions to stop them being called when the component is rendered
- the entire file is javascript. functions do not need to be rendered in the html, they can be declared alongside the App() function, for example
